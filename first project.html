    <h1> Welcome to my first program! </h1>
    <script>
/*IDEA:
-the input of the user is recorded
-a random number creates a random computer choice
-input and computer choice are compared to each other and the program shows who wins and records the games statistics

to add:
-statistics!! perhaps shown on the site in a grid?
-a game controller that gets rid of the need to reload
-make first character upper case
